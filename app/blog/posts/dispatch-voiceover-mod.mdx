I recently [made a mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/dispatch/mods/26) for [Dispatch](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2592160/Dispatch/) (probably my GOTY - it's really good)

The mod (like maybe most of my mods?) is a silly one - one of the characters in the game, Sonar, is voiced by none other than MoistCr1Tikal

So understandably the modding potential is insane. For the mod I chose a specific moment in one of the episodes (without giving away too much spoilers), where Sonar sabotages a teammate which reminded me of the iconic "Misinput"

I've been messing with Unreal for months as a game dev, but first time as a modder. Dispatch is built with Unreal 4, and unlike Cyberpunk modding - there is no real single mod editor like Wolvenkit for it - it's a bit distributed for reasons I think I understand (there are SO many UE games). Regardless - apart from having to use 4 or 5 tools, the tools themselves are solid and do what they do well. I decided to write this down for future me and anyone else looking to mod Dispatch. 

I obviously don't know everything and given this is my first UE mod - I'm sure there are better ways to do things (I really just rushed through most of this)

My usual modding disclaimer: This guide assumes you own the game. Support Adhoc Studio - they made something really good.

This guide covers the workflow for replacing Voice Over (VO) and Subtitles in Dispatch. The specific example used here modifies a line for the character **Sonar** in **Episode 103**, but the logic applies to all episodes.

## The Toolkit

*   **[UE4 AES Key Extracting Guide](https://github.com/Cracko298/UE4-AES-Key-Extracting-Guide)**: Required to get the encryption key.
*   **[FModel](https://github.com/4sval/FModel)**: Asset explorer.
*   **[Fmod Bank Tools](https://github.com/Wouldubeinta/Fmod-Bank-Tools)**: For unpacking/repacking `.bank` audio files.
*   **[UnrealLocresEditor](https://github.com/Snoozeds/UnrealLocresEditor)**: GUI tool to edit binary localization files.
*   **[repak](https://github.com/trumank/repak)**: Command-line tool to pack mods.
*   **[Dispatch Debug Menu](https://www.nexusmods.com/dispatch/mods/8)**: *Essential.* Allows skipping cinematics and jumping to specific shifts.

## 1. Setup & Exploration

### FModel Configuration
1.  Open FModel.
2.  **Add Game**: Point the directory to `...\Steam\steamapps\common\Dispatch\Dispatch`.
3.  **Set Encryption**: In Settings, paste the AES key (extracted using the guide above).
4.  **Load**: FModel will now list the file contents.

### Understanding the PAK Structure
*Dispatch* organizes data sequentially. Knowing this saves search time:
*   **pakchunk0-1**: Core/Shared assets.
*   **pakchunk2**: Episode 1 Data (Localization, Assets).
*   **pakchunk3**: Episode 1 Cinematics (`.webm`).
*   **pakchunk4**: Episode 2 Data.
*   **pakchunk5**: Episode 2 Cinematics.
*   *(Pattern continues: even numbers are Data, odd numbers are Movies).*

## 2. Asset Identification

Do not listen to every audio file blindly. Match the Script ID to the Audio ID.

1.  **Search**: In FModel, search the relevant `pakchunk` (e.g., chunk 2/3 for Ep 1, or chunk 6/7 for Ep 3) for the dialogue line name (e.g., `Line_Sonar_`).
2.  **Extract ID**: Note the unique suffix in the filename (e.g., `Line_Sonar_bfc02e` -> ID: **bfc02e**).
3.  **Match**: This ID corresponds to the `.wav` filename inside the FMOD bank.

**Quick-Search Script (PowerShell)**
Save as `find_asset.ps1` and run to quickly find assets in encrypted PAKs without extracting everything:
```powershell
param($Pak, $AesKey, $Query)
.\repak.exe --aes-key $AesKey list $Pak | Select-String -SimpleMatch $Query
```

## 3. Replacing Audio

*Dispatch* loads audio from loose bank files on disk (banks aren't inside paks). You do not need `repak` for the VOs.

1.  **Locate**: Go to `Dispatch\Content\FMOD\Desktop`.
2.  **Select Bank**: Find the bank for your Episode (e.g., `Shift03AVO.bank` for Ep 103).
3.  **Extract**: Use **Fmod Bank Tools** -> "Extract".
4.  **Swap**:
    *   Open the `wav` folder.
    *   Replace the file matching your ID (e.g., `bfc02e.wav`).
    *   *Requirement*: Match the sample rate. Matching duration isn't a hard requirement, but it's recommended (more due to the subtitle timing, which we aren't modifying)
5.  **Rebuild**: Use **Fmod Bank Tools** -> "Rebuild".
6.  **Install**: Overwrite the `.bank` file in the game directory with your new one.

## 4. Replacing Subtitles 

Subtitles are stored in `.locres` files.

1.  **Export**: In FModel, find the localization file (e.g., `pakchunk2` -> `Dispatch/Content/Localization/103/en/103.locres`). Right-click -> "Export Raw Data".
2.  **Edit**:
    *   Open **UnrealLocresEditor**.
    *   Load the exported `.locres` file.
    *   Search for your Line ID (e.g., `1FC02E62...`) and change the text.
    *   Save.
3.  **Pack**:
    *   Create a folder `MyMod`.
    *   Recreate the **exact** game path inside: `MyMod\Dispatch\Content\Localization\103\en\`.
    *   Place the modified `.locres` inside.
    *   Run repak:
        ```powershell
        .\repak.exe pack "MyMod" "Dispatch_Mod_ZZ_Subs_P.pak"
        ```
    
4.  **Install**: Place the `.pak` file in `Dispatch\Content\Paks`.

## 5. Testing

Launch the game. Use the **Dispatch Debug Menu** mod to help speed up testing and jump directly to the Shift/Episode you modified.

And that's it! You can use the same principle to replace any VO or subtitle (or for that matter, any asset) in the game. I want to also try modding Blueprints but that's for another day. Happy modding!
